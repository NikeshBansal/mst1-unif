	\section{Market Situation}
	\subsection{Potential Market and Competitors}
	As per an article by bike-eu.com, the statistics show that in the year 2014, 133.1 million bicycles were sold resulting in the global cycling market of about € 35.7 billion. Thus, the average cost of a bicycle was approximately € 191 in 2014. The Europe alone contributed approximately € 12.8 billion which was 36\% of the global cycling market. A report ‘Growth Opportunities in the Global Bicycle Industry 2016-2021: Trends, Forecast, and Opportunity Analysis’ by Lucintel states that the global bicycle market is estimated to reach \$ 59.9 billion by the end of 2021. So, these statistics clearly show the increasing market for our product. \\
	Comment on increasing demand for bike accessories even more than new bikes (http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/leisure/mad-about-the-bike-sales-of-bicycle-accessories-outstrip-sales-of-bikes)\\[0.5cm]
	There is a French start-up ‘Connected Cycle’ which is working on the similar product and could be our competitor in the market. As per their website, the pedals will be launched in 2017. Their main dedication is to make the bikes and e-bikes fully connected to the smartphones, thus providing fitness tracking capabilities and location tracking facilities due to GSM and GPS modules inside their circuits. When the user starts pedaling, the sensors gets activated and the information regarding the location, speed and calories burned can be accessed by their connected cycle application. (which is yet to be launched)\\
	Connected Cycle successfully conducted an online crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.com. They were able to raise \$177,212 which was 188\% more than their target while selling their product for a early bird offer of \$189 for a pair of smart bike pedals.
	
	\subsection{Target Customers}
	Our product can be used by any bike-rider by replacing the normal pedals of the bike by our smart pedals. Also, our product can be used by those people who care about the environment but can’t switch to bicycles because they worry about their bicycles getting stolen. The main advantage would be the theft-protection, by being energy autonomous pedals, which normal bikes can’t offer. \\ 
	Many smart features in one product. \\ 
	Regular bike riders (more than once a week). Specially urban dwellers.
	
	\subsection{Evolution of Fitting Market}
	According to an article ‘Germany’s vicious cycle of bike thefts’ by ‘www.local.de’ on 17th July 2014, on an average 52\% German regularly ride the bike and there are 2.4 bicycles in every household. In the year 2013, a total of 317,000 bicycles were reported stolen in Germany and only 9.6\% of them were recovered. But many more bikes are stolen but not reported. Most of these stolen bikes are sold again in flea markets and on internet. As per the police, it’s easy to find the stolen car because of the unique number stamped on the engine but very few people take initiative to get a unique number framed for their bikes, which will make it easy to find the stolen bike.\\  
	Increasing number of smart bike accessories and their demand and also increasing number of bikes leads to more demand.

	\subsection{Comparable Products}
	In the below table, a number of well-known products are mentioned which share their function with the product proposed in this document. The current price of these products are also cited approximately with their corresponding deviation. We must however note that despite the last product, connected cycle®, all other products mentioned in the below table have completely separate functions from each other. Yet, the last one is a pedal which covers some of the functions of the other products. Namely, this pedal is used for bike-theft protection and also for presenting statistical information such as speed and distance for fitness purposes. [?mentioning where we have got these prices values from][??picture for connected cycle?]\\
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{|C{6cm}|C{3cm}|C{4cm}|}
				\hline
				Available Products & Average Cost & Cost Deviation  \\
				\hline
				Conventional Bike Pedals & \euro 15 & \euro 5\\
				\hline
				Bicycle back-light sets & \euro 10 & \euro 5\\
				\hline
				Bicycle speedometers & \euro 15 & \euro 10\\
				\hline
				Popular bicycle locks & \euro 40 & \euro 20 \\ 
				\hline
				Bicycle dynamo & \euro 30 & \euro 5 \\
				\hline
				Connected cycle & \euro 170 & \euro 30 \\
				\hline
				
				
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Product Costs}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	
	\subsection{Selling Price Estimation}
	The products remarked in the above table cover a number of functions, all of which are included in the product which is proposed in this document. There is already a considerable number of customers who buy a complete set of the above products (excluding Connected cycle, and pedals) for their bicycles and spent nearly 95 euros. Therefore, if the price of our product is below this number and if we can indeed make our customers confident enough that our product is satisfactory as a substitute of the above products, we can be confident about the absolute willingness of the customers for buying it. However, we have also observed a quite a large market demand for this new product of Connected cycle pedals which charges its customers nearly 170 euros for a pair of pedals. Therefore, with respect to the extra functions which our product presents in comparison to all the above examples, and by taking into account the available market demand, we can be confident about selling this product if the price is below 170 euros, and also to outcompete the similar producers in the market. In addition, the current bicycle manufacturers can also additionally, be our potential customers who can consider this product as a substitute for the conventional embedded pedals to attract more customers in selling their bicycles. Here, the price of this pedal can be more flexible upwards with respect to price of the bicycle itself. Furthermore, the local governments who are willing to either monitor the bike traffic or manage bicycle fleets can offer subsidy for this product. On the other hand, the fact that how much a customer would be willing to pay for this product also depends on the price of his own bicycle. Generally, for bicycle users who already have the aforementioned products, it can be the additional feature of our product, namely, being smart, that can be compelling for buying it.  
	
	
	\subsection{Sales Number Estimation}
	As an example, in Europe which is one of the best potential markets, about 20 million new bicycles were sold on 2014. Here, an ideal case would be if all the customers of these bicycles consider our product an appealing substitute for not buying locks, light sets, dynamos, and speedometers, besides achieving additional functions. Therefore, maximum the same number can be the number of sales in such year. However, as the customers’ view can be rather subjective, we can only say that it greatly depends on the price of our product and how much we can attract our customers to this product for how much the sales number will be. We must also note the degree of availability of our product in the market, and how many of the new bicycle owners notice our product as other factors in our sales number. \\ 
	Similarly, as aforementioned, approximately 130 million bicycles (adult bicycle?) were sold on 2014 in the world []. Here, the price of our product plays a greater role for how much our sales number can be as our customers’ ability to afford it deviates in a broader range than Europe. Above all, with respect to the feedbacks which we get from the market in the initial phases of presenting our product we can make a better approximation about this matter. \\
	In addition, the connected cycle has already sold ….. number. Therefore, with respect to how better our product is visualized in the market, our sales number can also be expected between this number and a half of it.

		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	\subsection{Target Places}
	Initially, we would like to aim some of the most bike-friendly cities and countries where the number of bicycle riders are relatively high and the price of our product can be considered reasonable for customers. Namely, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, France, England, Ireland, USA, Canada, China, Russia and etc. are examples of such countries. After receiving our feedbacks from the market and customers, and perhaps, modifying our product we can consider a broader range of countries to present this product in. In addition, as the manufacturing rate of our product increases we might be able to decrease the price and sell in countries where our new prices can be considered more affordable. [refrence?]
